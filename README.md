# RobloxBlacklistChecks

**RobloxBlacklistChecks** is a script set for Roblox developers that simplifies the process of blacklisting players, groups, and avatar items across multiple games. Instead of manually adding bans or updating each game individually, this script automatically pulls blacklist data from a Pastebin database. By maintaining and updating the Pastebin database, you can manage your game's blacklist efficiently without additional manual work.

## Features

- Automatically checks if a player is blacklisted.
- Blacklists players by user ID, groups, and avatar items.
- Pulls blacklist data from a Pastebin database for easy updates.
- Streamlined integration across multiple games.
- Requires no manual updates to individual game files after initial setup.

## Requirements

- **HTTP Requests** must be enabled in your Roblox game settings.

## Installation

1. **Enable HTTP Requests** in Roblox Studio:
   - Open Roblox Studio.
   - Go to **Game Settings** > **Security**.
   - Enable the **Allow HTTP Requests** option.

2. **Create and Maintain a Pastebin Database**:
   - Create a Pastebin file containing blacklisted user IDs, group IDs, and avatar item IDs.
   - Format the data as needed (example provided below).
   - Keep the Pastebin link updated for consistent blacklist checks.

3. **Download and Implement the RobloxBlacklistChecks Script**:
   - Place the  scripts in **ServerScriptService** or another appropriate location.
   - Configure the script with your Pastebin URL.


4. **Customize** any additional settings or behavior as needed for your game.



## Usage

Once the script is in place and correctly configured:

- The script will check players, groups, and avatar items at runtime.
- If a blacklisted entity is detected, the script can take predefined actions, such as kicking the player or displaying a warning message.


Customize this function to define the behavior when a blacklist match is found.

## Updating the Blacklist

- Simply update the Pastebin file with new blacklisted entries.
- No changes are needed within your Roblox game after initial setup.

## Important Notes

- **HTTP Requests must remain enabled** for the script to work.
- Be cautious with the size and frequency of your requests to avoid exceeding Roblox API limits.
